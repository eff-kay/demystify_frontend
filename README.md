# demystify_frontend
This is a repository for the front end code of demystify.io. Demystify is a crowdsourced translation of famous literature in any langauge. Our aim with this project is to revive the old languages that are being wiped away because they have limited internet users. The internet should have made it easier to read and understand literature and thoughts from esoteric languages. But that has not been the case. 

We will focus on poems but our goal for the platform will be to make it suitable for prose as well.  

## GOALS
### Central repository for all text irrespective of their users
### Famous literature from lesser known languages translated into English
### Sort the different poems from different languages based on thoughts
